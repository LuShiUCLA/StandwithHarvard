- Strategy: Whether the cohort received PAD screening (Screen) or not (No_Screen).
- Perspective: 'medicaid' (direct medical costs only) or 'societal' (includes productivity and welfare).
- Horizon: Time window in years.
- Treatment_Cost: Total cost of screening and preventive therapy for the cohort.
- Event_Cost: Total cost incurred by MACE and ESRD events in the cohort.
- Total_Cost: Sum of Treatment_Cost and Event_Cost.
- MACE_Events: Number of major adverse cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke) in the cohort.
- ESRD_Events: Number of end-stage renal disease events in the cohort.
- Deaths: Number of deaths in the cohort over the time horizon.
- QALY: Total quality-adjusted life years for the cohort (after subtracting QALY loss from events).
- Monetized_QALY: Total QALYs multiplied by the societal willingness-to-pay per QALY.
- Productivity_Gain: Societal productivity gain from MACE/ESRD events averted.
- Welfare_Program_Saving: Societal welfare program cost saving from MACE/ESRD events averted.
- Net_Benefit: Monetized_QALY plus Productivity_Gain and Welfare_Program_Saving, minus Total_Cost.

# 5. PEDAGOGICAL NOTE:
cat("
Pedagogical Note:
This model simulates a large cohort (100,000) to ensure event counts are realistic integers. 
It explicitly models major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 
with all costs and QALY losses assigned to these events. 
Societal perspective includes not only direct medical costs, but also productivity and welfare program impacts.
Incremental treatment costs and event-related cost savings are reported separately, 
so decision makers can see both the costs of early detection and the savings from events averted.
